# NationStates-Stats
Data extraction and Analysis for NationStates' Nation Stats.

## About NationStates
From its homepage: NationStates is a nation simulation game. Create a nation according to your political ideals and care for its people. Or deliberately oppress them. It's up to you.

So one of the aspects of the game involve Issues, whereby you answer issues and problems that pop up on your nation. These have positive and negative impacts on your nation's statistics, depending on your choice.

It came with the very first question I had: By *how* much does Integrity change with Authoritarianism (attribute of being a dictatorship)?

I have written more about it here as part of NationStates' Great Exhibition 2021: https://nsge.jcink.net/index.php?showtopic=72.

## How to run
Simply ensure that you have the required packages, the attached data, and it should be good to go. Please do note that the data is limited to 50,000 nations due to the sheer size.

## Credits
Various credits are given in each of the snippets where I have taken some ideas here and there from StackOverflow.
